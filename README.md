# linux-workshop-se

Hello and welcome!

This repository contains the names of everyone who has completed the last day
of the Linux Workshop: Day 4, Linux for Software Engineers.

If you were not able to attend this day, fret not, I hope to publish a manual
before finals of Semester 1 2023-2024.

For everyone else, thank you so much for attending and I sincerely wish you
the best!

I hope to have helped you in learning how to use Linux. See you next time!
